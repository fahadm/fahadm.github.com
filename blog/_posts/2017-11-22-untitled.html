He walked away, with a broken smile. Engulfed by a pensive sadness. He wanted to stay, he wanted to believe. But the truth in the end was that he wasn’t what he wanted to be. Was this really everything he ever wanted. He wanted to stay there forever, but fate had other ideas. He wanted to scream to shout out till his last breath. He was not where he wanted to be, not like this he thought. With eyes dim, and head down, he walked away.

He didn’t know where to go or what to do now. His life had been full of temporary highs and temporary friends. But there was nothing he could have done. He wanted to hold on, but all he could manage to do was fall down, over and over again.

But every time he fell down, he wasn’t beaten, he got back up and tried to hold on on more time. But this time, it was different. He had been beaten and broken. For everything he though he was, he was not. The image of his former self was like a broken picture with a million little shards, all over the place. He wanted to pick them up and glue them together, but alas, all he was able to do, was to break them further.

He looked back one more time, he wanted to be more, to do more. But everything he did, was for not. For he had been broken. Not by something external, but by himself.

As he walked away, in the pitch dark night, the old familiar voice came back to him. All the naysayers and disbelievers were right, maybe he was nothing. Maybe he didn’t deserve to be where he was. Maybe it was all a sham, a scam, a trick.
