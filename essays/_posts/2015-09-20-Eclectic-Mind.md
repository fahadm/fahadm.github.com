The mind is an interesting thing. It thinks when it is supposed to do and it does things when it is supposed to think. The vagarious thoughts come and go until the mind becomes numb, unable to comprehend or do anything. The thoughts can be as simple as what Am I doing here or why am I doing this and they can be as complex as what it means to be real.
In a conformist society, your mind is told that it has to do things, follow rules, to do different things without purpose or much meaning. One of the first things a a society tells you to is to conform to a religion. And then instead of thinking about things which may or may not be important, you go out in the search for something as obfuscated as God.

And the search starts, as all searches start. You feel as though you have a higher purpose in this world. So you read and ask questions such as what is God? Is He watching. The moral and ethical values are ingrained into you in the form of religion. You no longer are thinking about stuff that is important but you think about the Almighty, you start to rationalize all decisions based on religion. Until one day you realize that religion is important but only up to an extant.

After religion you focus on the meaning of life, what it means to be real, tobe conscious. Many people find life meaningless although some people think that the meaning of life is to survive, to pass off their genes to their off springs and see then grow up. But in a purely rational setting, the inevitable conclusion is that there is no meaning to life. Life is just something as insignificant as the number 42. ( apologies to Douglas Adams).


The next step in this journey of the mind is to find love to understand human emotions, to see why people do what they do. The mind tries to rationalize that everything is for a reason. However absurd that rationalization might be. This life is a hodgepodge of emotions and hormones which causes those emotions to be realized.
