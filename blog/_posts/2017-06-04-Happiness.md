What is happiness but a struggle to come to peace, with your own existence. Is it a process or is it a state? This is a hard question. For some may find it in the ordinary struggles of the world while others might find it in achievements throughout their lives.

My father told me once that only that place is good for you is where you have friends. And I didn’t know what that meant for a very long time. All my life I had tried to find happiness in achievements and in people. I treated it as a panacea. Something to fix everything.

But it wasn’t. Only you can fix yourself. For people, relationships and friendships are all transitory.

There is no such thing as true happiness, because when you’re there, the place you wanted to be at. You will still be as unhappy as you started with.

And if you keep on running away, chasing after that true happiness, you will never find it. To find happiness you have to find yourself, and to find yourself you need to find your soul.

Sometimes it lurks around you, if you’re too busy chasing a shadow of a hope, you can never find it. For it fades away little by little.

So stay there, take a breath, look around and stop running away. And maybe you’ll see how beautiful the chaos is, in this complex world.
