You should be able to do X. I thought you did Y. Why haven't you done Z. The voices linger in your head like needles, pulsating along only to remind you of your failure to be something that you couldn't be. You want the voices to stop, you want to tell everyone that you are trying your best and you do. But the voices don't leave, they haunt you, they make you feel ashamed. In the end all you can do is try and wait. But people will always inquire, snoop around in places that they don't belong and and say spiteful and evil things. What they don't realize is that these words can kill individuals, they can send one into an unending depression.

Sometimes all you can do is wait and ignore the people who never cared, the expectations ever unfulfilled. For in the end you will be alone, you will have to face your own demons and no one will tell you what to do and what not to do. You will be free at last from the shackles of the society, as you breathe your last on your death bed. No one will have anymore expectations from you.
