I remember being afraid, afraid of what people would think of me. How people would judge me on my actions. Even when I was little my weltanschauung was to either put a smile on the faces of others or to keep to myself and be invisible. The days of my college although not very eventful were full of me feeling insecure about how my actions would affect others. 

It was particularly surprising when a person in my class (back in my sophomore year) called me out in front of the course instructor and said that I was selfish and that i thought i was better than others. This was shocking, it made me realize that i wasn't doing enough for others, from that day onwards I brought a change in myself, to proactively help others.

The reason I mentioned that predicament here is that after that event I changed my world view, I was no longer bound by the negative emotions, I became rather stoic. I stopped judging others. What this did in the long run was that it made me appreciate the beauty that is life. I was no longer worrying about the minor details in life, I didn't hate anyone, I was never jealous. 

I started seeing the world from the perspective of others, although it is not possible to completely understand how another person operates, but through your limited interaction with an individual your brain subconsciously trains itself to think like that individual. Using this innate ability you can really bring about a positive change in yourself and in others around you too. 

If everyone started looking at the world through eyes of other people, the world would really be a better place.
